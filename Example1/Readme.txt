This program is supposed to print the subject stats for a set of students including the average and top students' names and grades.
If a student doesn't have a grade in that particular subject, the program should IGNORE that student 
 - If there are no students at all who have taken a given subject, the output should be blank.
 - When finding the average score, the code should only divide by the number of students who have taken that subject
The program should report ties for the top score (print all students' names with the top score and their score)
The test cases provided to you in the 'cases' folder will highlight all of the bugs you need to fix.
