**Course Scheduling Problem**

**Problem Overview**

The CourseScheduler problem involves finding a valid order in which courses can be taken given a set of course prerequisites. The task is to determine whether it is possible to complete all the courses and if so, provide a valid order for the courses to be taken. Each course may have multiple prerequisites, and some courses can be taken independently. The problem is a classic Topological Sorting problem in directed acyclic graphs (DAG).

**Problem Details:**
You are given a list of courses and their prerequisites. For example, Course A might require Course B to be taken first.

Your task is to output a valid order in which the courses should be taken.

If there is no way to satisfy all prerequisites (due to circular dependencies), you should print a message indicating that it's not possible to complete all courses or make sure the output is an empty list [] or null

**What You Need To Do**

Your task is to debug the provided CourseScheduler.java file and make sure it functions correctly. The provided code contains some bugs that prevent it from properly generating the correct course schedule.

What You Should Do:
Fix the code: Identify and fix the issues in the provided buggy code to make sure it correctly handles the problem.

Understand the Problem: Once you have fixed the code, you can use the test cases in the cases.txt file to verify the correctness of your solution. Just copy paste the test case to the appropriate portion of the main method. 

Run the Program: After debugging the code, run the program and make sure it outputs the correct course schedule based on the prerequisites.
